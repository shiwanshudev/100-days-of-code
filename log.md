# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: October 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Add credential provider as authentication for medicine management app. Learned about SQL commands UPDATE and DELETE from Stephen Grider's course.

**Thoughts:** I learned about the SQL statements and tried them out for practicing. Setting up the credential provider is quite the challenge. The documentation uses V4 next-auth which is basically for the pages router. However, after struggling for a while I need to focus on the V5 the beta version.

### Day 1: October 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learned more about next-auth, worked on cssbattle challenge and learned about one to many and many to one relationships.

**Thoughts:** I feel like despite putting in the time it didn't feel like it was enough. May be because I didn't actually built something.

### Day 2: October 30, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Learned about One to One, Many to Many relationship, Primary Key and Foreign Key. Created Sign Up and Sign In page using shadcn for next-auth. 

**Thoughts:** I felt like I did make some progress but still effort was lacking I think. I need to become more focused towards my goals and avoid distractions.
